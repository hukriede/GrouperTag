Grouper have never been able to be seen spawning and spawning locations are not known. Using SparkFun's Razor 9DoF board equipped with accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, this could be possible. The accelerometer can sample as high as 1000Hz which will be extremely useful in detecting sound vibrations that the species is making which has been known to be a proxy for spawning/mating. Grouper are a vital part of the ecosystem of many coastal regions and more knowledge about them will greatly benefit scientific sutdies in the future. 

This is the background code that you will need to upload to your SparkFun Razor IMU in order to begin reading and writing data to the local Micro SD Card. Please download all the necessary code files and libraries and if you have further questions refer to the setup guide provided by spark fun here:

I have also equipped this board with available wireless Qi charging, a Blue Robotics Bar30 temperature/pressure sensor, and Adafruit low energy Bluetooth capabilities.
