# GrouperTag

Grouper have never been able to be seen spawning and spawning locations are not known. Using SparkFun's Razor 9DoF board equipped with accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, this could be possible. Grouper are a vital part of the ecosystem of many coastal regions and more knowledge about them will greatly benefit scientific sutdies in the future.
