Grouper have never been able to be seen spawning and spawning locations are not known. Using SparkFun's Razor 9DoF board equipped with accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, this could be possible. The accelerometer can sample as high as 1000Hz which will be extremely useful in detecting sound vibrations that the species is making which has been known to be a proxy for spawning/mating. Grouper are a vital part of the ecosystem of many coastal regions and more knowledge about them will greatly benefit scientific sutdies in the future. 

I have also equipped this board with available wireless Qi charging, a Blue Robotics Bar30 temperature/pressure sensor, and Adafruit low energy Bluetooth capabilities.
